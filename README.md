# Callum's dot files
This is a collection of my dot files. 

## How to use

Clone down the repository
`git clone https://github.com/CallumCarmicheal/dotfiles.git ~/.config/crc.files`

And then select your environment and run its setup script. 
For example: 
`/bin/bash ~/.config/crc.files/neptunium/setup.sh`

This script will run and setup any symbolic links to the dot files.

This setup script is still yet to be written, in most cases it might become an interactive C++ project or maybe
a simple PHP script. The type of script is yet to be decided. This line will be updated with docs for the script
when ever it is created.
